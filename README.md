# KeyLogLite
Lightweight keylogger

This is a lightweight python keylogger that can be ran from the cmd line.
It will record keystrokes into a file called "keylogger.txt" within the local dir that its being ran from.

*NOTE* THIS FILE IS NOT TO BE USED IN A MALICIOUS MANNER, IT'S PURELY FOR EDUCATIONAL/RECREATIONAL PURPOSES!

**Usage**: You need to run the file with super user priviledges in order to use the *keyboard* python library.

`main.py [--sm,--screenshot]`
--sm: screenshot mode (disabled by default) , will take a screenshot every 60 seconds and save them to a local dir (./screenshot)
